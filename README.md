## Introduction

In this section, provide a brief overview of the robot and its purpose. Explain what the code in this repository does and how it contributes to the robot's functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with developing and running the robot code, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html)

### Setting up the Development Environment

Install WPILib Visual Studio Code by following the instructions in the [WPILib documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html).

### Downloading the Robot Code

1. Clone or download the Robot2024 repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

### Building and Deploying the Code

To build and deploy the code to the robot, follow these steps:

1. Connect your computer to the robot's network.
2. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.
3. Run the build command by typing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and searching for "WPILib: Build Robot Code".
4. Once the build is successful, run the deploy command by typing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and searching for "WPILib: Deploy Robot Code".
5. Monitor the deployment process in the console output of Visual Studio Code.
6. Once the deployment is successful, you can interact with the robot using the deployed code.

For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips, refer to the [WPILib documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html).

We hope this guide helps you get started with developing and running the robot code. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out for assistance.
## Usage

To deploy the Java code to the robot, we will be using WPILib. Follow the steps below:

1. Install VSCode from WPILib.
2. Open your robot project in the IDE.
3. Build your robot code by running the build command (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + P` and search for "WPILib: Build Robot Code").
4. Connect your computer to the robot's network.
5. Deploy the code to the robot by running the deploy command (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + P` and search for "WPILib: Deploy Robot Code").
6. Monitor the deployment process in the console output of your IDE.
7. Once the deployment is successful, you can interact with the robot using the deployed code.

Make sure to consult the WPILib documentation for more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.

Note: The above steps assume you have already set up the development environment and have the necessary dependencies installed. If not, please refer to the "Getting Started" section for instructions on setting up the environment.
